# mutestofCNN
This is a master thesis proposal.
Aims at applying Mutation Testing to test Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network) by analyzing and evaluating the quality perfromance of the model.
The CNN is as well to be tested and executed together with another diferrent application (Driving controller) in a deep autonomous driving system.
