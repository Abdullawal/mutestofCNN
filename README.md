# mutestofCNN
This is a master thesis proposal.
Aims at applying Mutation Testing to test Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network) to analyze and evaluate the quality perfromance of the DL model.
The CNN is as well to be tested and executed together with another diferrent application (Driving controller) in a deep autonomous driving system.
