# Mutation Testing of Convolutional Neural Network (mutestofCNN)
This is a master thesis proposal that proposes applying Mutation Testing technique to test Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network) to evaluate the model's quality performance. The thesis aim to analyze and evaluate the performance of the CNN model in autonomous deep driving system by examining how mutated CNN behavior performance triggers different driving decision result.
