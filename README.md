# Improving Test Cases Using Mutation Testing on Convolutional Neural Networks with Diverse States (mutestofCNN)
This is a master thesis proposal that proposes applying Mutation Testing technique to test a Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network implemented in a deep driving framweork). The thesis aims at analyzing and evaluating of the performance accuracy of test cases, it involves designing of two groups of mutation operators that inject faults/mutants into the data or program (AUT) and defining of the test cases to catck and kill the mutants. Also, Challenges faced when applying MT is investigated and recommended solutions are proposed.
