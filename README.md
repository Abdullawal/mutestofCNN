# Mutation Testing of Convolutional Neural Network (mutestofCNN)
This is a master thesis proposal.
that proposes applying Mutation Testing technique to test Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network), analyzing and evaluating the quality perfromance of the model.
The CNN is as well to be tested and executed together with another diferrent application (Driving controller) in a deep autonomous driving system.
